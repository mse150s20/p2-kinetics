# Overview of Code
The purpose of this code is to describe and model the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the state of Idaho. With this, we hope to provide information on how well Idaho is dealing with COVID-19.

The idaho_infections.csv file can be found under the data directory. This file contains data from the sources provided below. It models the pandemic in Idaho as kinetic function of time in days, with equations that model the uninfected, infected, recovered, and deaths in Idaho. This file is probably the most important and valuable file in this project! 


# Software Requirements
This code requires access to a commandline terminal and to have a github account to access the p2-kinetics repository and to be able to track and collaborate with other researchers on this topic. For this program to run, python must be installed on the local machine. To download Python go to terminal, type in the command line "apt-get install python". This will start downloading Python onto the local machine. It will ask a few permission questions and you will have to let it install Python onto the local machine. Depending on the machine you are using you may have do download an additional program in the same mannor. Mac users, such as myself, running older operating systems have to download XQuartz. Without it my code ran but there was no visual graph of the data, but with XQuartz downloaded it worked as it should. The code also requires that numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sys, and scipy (for solve_ivp) to be imported. All the previously mentioned modules will run when the code is initiated. 

# How to Get This Code
To run the code on your computer, pull the p2-kinetics repository from github class master to your terminal, or fork the repository and pull the code from your own personal repository. Once you've done this you can now access all files needed. This code should give you the ability to graph the data colected as well as access the idaho_infections.csv file in order to view the raw data yourself. An example would be `$ git clone git@github.com:mse150s20/p2-kinetics.git`. 

It models the pandemic in Idaho as a kinetics function of time in days, with equations that model the uninfected, infected, recovered, and fatalities in Idaho.

# File Descriptions

### Images
The Images Directory is the place where all the graphs are saved to so they are in a centeralized location.

### Data
The data directory contains text files and .csv files from group research sources. Our working model pulls data from this directory when generating our model.
idaho_infections.csv is one example of the files contained in this directory. The idaho_infections.csv file contains the reported numbers of the total reported infections, fatalities, and recoveries in Idaho. The file starts on March 13th, the first day of reported cases in the state. It also includes the number of new cases of each designation. This csv file works in conjunction with Model_VS_Real_Data.py as it will show the comparison of the reported data alongside the projected data of the model. 

### General_Playing
The General_Playing directory contains several working models to be manipulated in order to determine the best fit for the k1 and k2 values of the final predictive model. These models cover varying infection rates, recovery rates, and comparisons to the current to-date data from our sources.  

### finding.py - Still needs defined

### plot-infections.py
When pulling from Data/idaho_infections.csv, this graph plots actual numbers of infections and fatalities in the state of Idaho from day 0, as the first person was infected, to most current update of covid-19 statistics.

    Modeling kinetics: rate of change between things!

    Healthy -> Infected -> Recovered

The rates of change between Healthy->Infected and Infected->Recovered will show us how quickly COVID-19 spreads and how quickly people are recovering.

The equation for finding how many new infections per day is (rInfect\*Healthy\*Infected)/(Healthy+Infected+Recovered). Applying this tells us that initially when almost everyone is Healthy and very few are infected, the growth of infection is very slow. When Healthy and Infected numbers are equal to each other, the growth of infected is at its peak.

### Definitions

Healthy: This is how many healthy, uninfected people there are in Idaho.

Infected: This is the number of documented COVID-19 positive people there are in Idaho.

Recovered: This is the number of people who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection.

rInfect: This is a constant that is multiplied by the number of Healthy people. The product of Healthy times rInfect gives us the number of new Infections per day.

Recover: This is a constant that is multiplied by the number of Infected people. The product of Infected time rRecover gives us the number of new Recovered people per day.
The rate at which people recover is completely dependent on how many infected people there are thus the equation for new Recovered is (rRecovered\*Infected). Applying this information tells us as the number of Infected people goes up, the number ofnew Recovered people will also go up. The peak of Recoveries will be when there the greatest number of Infected people.

rRecover: This is a constant that is multiplied by the number of Infected people. The product of Infected time rRecover gives us the number of new Recovered people per day.
The rate at which people recover is completely dependent on how many infected people there are thus the equation for new Recovered is (rRecovered\*Infected). Applying this information tells us as the number of Infected people goes up, the number of new Recovered people will also go up. The peak of Recoveries will be when there the greatest number of Infected people.

# Conclusion
Our data shows a spike in the beginning when we were not prepared or taking the necessary steps to prevent COVID-19 from spreading. Since the social distancing order was put into place, the curve has flattened a little so we should continue to distance as much as possible until we have more information or more people have recovered so we have a better chance of overcoming this virus.

There are a lot of variables to consider when deciding on the future of virus precautions. The `idaho_infections.csv` data, with our higher k1 variable to more closely represent the standard curve, indicates the virus is not spreading as quickly as predicted. Something else to consider is, due to the likelihood that a vaccine will not be ready within the year, gradual re-introduction of people into society to start building immunity may be the best option.

Due to economic reasons the state of Idaho cannot remain closed until the curve begins to flatten.

Governor Little of Idaho has introduced a 4-stage plan to reopen the state of Idaho. Each stage is to be carried out at 2-week increments and allow businesses to open up based on category. 

Governor Little's 4-stage plan to reopen the state of Idaho is a good step towards public re-introduction. As numbers in Idaho have still not peaked we may see an initial increase in the number of confirmed cases. This may reoccur at every stage of reopening as social distancing becomes less prevalent.   

As data continues to collect during this plan, our model will capture any impact of this plan. Action can be taken to reduce the speed of reintroduction if infections begin to spiral out of control. 

Personal safety is everyone's responsibility and social distancing and good hygiene is strongly encouraged. 


### Results From Playing With Parameters
The most apparent effect of decreasing k1 was delaying the "ramping up" of the population

### Visualizing the Results of Playing With the Parameters
Within the General_PLaying Folder, there is a file named "playing.py". By using vim to access the file, the variables k1 and k2 can be changed. Then, the playing.py file can be graphed be using the python command. The results of this graph will display the day in which there are the maximum number of cases. The color bar on the side can be used to indicate what conditions of k1 and k2 will produce the days of maximum cases.

### Playing Team Findings 
A higher k1 is required to get the infection to ramp up in a similar timeframe to the real infections (i.e. smaller k1 = later beginning of mass infection). However, a k2 is needed to control the k1; it can't be too big or too small as to squash the infected graph, or to let it grow exponentially large. Finer tuning needed.

### Playing team findings - NEED TO ELABORATE ON k1 and k2
A higher k1 is required to get the infection to ramp up in a similar timeframe to the real infections (i.e. smaller k1 = later beginning of mass infection). However, a k2 is needed to control the k1; it can't be too big or too small as to squash the infected graph or to let it grow exponentially large. Finer tuning needed.

As it stands the way that the graphs are generated it is not likely we will be able to make an accurate model. The data is still too young, and has too many outside factors; the current trend of the infections also does not match up with the form that the model graph takes.
